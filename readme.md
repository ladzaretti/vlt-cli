## Supported Platforms

- **OS**: Linux
  - Tested on (`amd64`):
    - Debian 12
    - Fedora 42
- **Arch**: Prebuilt binaries are available for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `386`.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download a release

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/ladzaretti/vlt-cli/releases) page for a list of available downloads.

#### Optional install script
After downloading and extracting an archive, the `install.sh` script can be used to:

- Copy the `vlt` and `vltd` binaries to `/usr/local/bin`
- Install and enable the `vltd` systemd user service for managing vault sessions

### Option 2: Build from source (requires Go 1.24)

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/ladzaretti/vlt-cli.git
cd vlt-cli
make build-dist

# Optional: run the install script
./dist/install.sh
```
This packs the `vlt` and `vltd` binaries in `./dist/`.

>[!NOTE]
> Installation via `go install` is not supported due to a patched vendored dependency.

## Design Overview
### vlt - cli client
The `vlt` cli manages secrets stored in a vault system composed of two layers:
- `vault_container.sqlite` is the outer SQLite database. It stores metadata and a single encrypted, serialized SQLite instance as a binary blob.
- `vault.sqlite` is a serialized and encrypted inner SQLite database that contains the actual user data.
  - The decrypted `vault.sqlite` is held in the `vlt` process memory only and is never written to disk.

### vltd - session manager daemon
The `vltd` daemon manages derived encryption keys and exposes a Unix socket that `vlt` uses to obtain them. Only `vlt` accesses the database files directly.

          EncryptedVault["vault.sqlite (encrypted serialized database blob)"]
        end
    end

    vlt["vlt (client)"]
    vltd["vltd (daemon)"]
    socket["Unix socket"]

    vlt -->|read/write| VaultContainer
    vlt -->|decrypt + access| EncryptedVault
    vlt -->|request/store session keys| socket --> vltd
```

## Crypto/Security
- **Key Derivation & Auth**: Uses `argon2id` to derive keys from the master password and verify authentication.

- **Encryption**:  
  - Secrets are encrypted with `AES-256-GCM`, using unique nonces for each encrypted value.  
  - The backing `SQLite` database is encrypted at rest and only decrypted into memory after authentication.

- **Memory-Safety**: Secrets are stored in memory only.

## Usage
```console
$ vlt --help

  config      Resolve and inspect the active vlt configuration (subcommands available)
  create      Initialize a new vault
  export      Export secrets to a file or stdout
  find        Search for secrets
  generate    Generate a random password
  help        Help about any command
  import      Import secrets from file (supports Firefox, Chromium, and custom formats)

Use "vlt [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Configuration file

The optional configuration file can be generated using `vlt config generate` command:

```toml
[vault]
# Vlt database path (default: '~/.vlt' if not set)
# path = ''
# How long a session lasts before requiring login again (default: '1m')
# session_duration = ''

# Clipboard configuration: Both copy and paste commands must be either both set or both unset.
[clipboard]
# The command used for copying to the clipboard (default: ['xsel', '-ib'] if not set)
# copy_cmd = []
# The command used for pasting from the clipboard (default: ['xsel', '-ob'] if not set)
# paste_cmd = []

# Optional lifecycle hooks for vault events
[hooks]
# Command to run after a successful login
# post_login_cmd = []
# Command to run after any vault write (e.g., create, update, delete)
# post_write_cmd = []
```
